# swiftBrainGame

## This game was created as a simple brain game to combat the 'stroop effect'

### Instructions: 

You have 1 minute to score as high as you can. The game tests whether or not you can discern the name of a color on the top from the actual color of the word below it. 

> For example: if the top word says blue, and the bottom word says red, but red is spelled with a blue font, you would press 'Yes' because the top word matches the actual color of the bottom word.
